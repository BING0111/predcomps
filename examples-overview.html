<h2>Examples Overview</h2>

<h3>Simulated Examples</h3>

<p>The simulated examples are constructed to demonstrate a property of predictive comparisons.  Simulated examples are nice because (since we set up the data-generating process and we really know what&#39;s going on) it&#39;s easier to know of the predictive comparisons are telling us what they should be. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="examples-logistic-regression.html">Logistic regression with related inputs</a>: This is a logistic regression model with no interactions, and where the coefficients are all the same. The distribution of the inputs leads to differences in the predictive comparisons (both APC and impact).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="examples-simulated-linear-model-interactions.html">Linear model with interactions</a>: This is a linear model with 9 features and 8 interaction terms (an interaction between \(v\) and each of \(u_1 \ldots u_8\)) which are all the same. The way the \(u_i\)&#39;s are related to \(v\) in the distribution of the inputs gives rise to differences in the APC.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Real Examples</h3>

<p>Simulated examples are good for gaining understanding of how the package works and what it&#39;s doing, but they don&#39;t help us understand how it is useful in the real world. These are examples with real-world data sets:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="examples-diamonds.html">Diamond prices</a>: In this example, applying predictive comparisons to a random forest helps understand the influence of carat, cut, color, and clarity on prices.</li>
</ul>
