## Future work

### Comparison with other approaches

For example, I'd like to compare with the tools (variable importance and partial plots) available in the `randomForest` package. I would guess that those tools are the most similar thing to this that's in common use.

Other notions of variable importance to compare with:

- the one in the `earth` package (implementing MARS)
- I should look through `caret` to see what's available there

### Categorical inputs

I'm not quite sure about the best way to sample from the distribution for an input of interest, conditional on the other inputs, when those other inputs include categorical variables.

Gelman & Pardoe 2007 discuss what to do when the input of interest is an unordered categorical variable, but I'm mainly interested in applying the statistic I'm calling [*impact*](impact.html) to categorical variables, since *impact* is comparable across all types of inputs.

### Uncertainty

As discussed in the paper, it is entirely natural to allow for multiple samples of parameters and plot these measures with their uncertainties as in the paper.

I'm also interested in the uncertainty that arises from the density estimation. 

### Weights

More study is necessary to understand better what the weights should be, and make automated choices.

### Code robustness

I should deal with potential column name conflicts in data frames (e.g. I use a "Weight" column, so I'll have problems if one of the inputs has that name).
