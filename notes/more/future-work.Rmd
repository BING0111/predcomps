## Future work

- Comparison with tools in the randomForest package
- make it work if categorical variables are includes in the inputs that aren't of interest
- make it work for categorical variables as input of interest
- unit testing
- uncertainty 
	- it would be pretty easy to allow for multiple samples of parameters and plot uncertainties as in the paper
	- I'm also interested in the uncertainty that arises from the density estimation as. I'm not that excited about displaying one source of uncertainty without at least having a sense for the other.
- deal with potential column name conflicts in data frames (e.g. what if "weight" is already a column of X, but I try to use it...)
- make it faster -- with large N, we should make distance matrix (much faster than I am now) and only keep a smaller number of the closest points
- better & more automated choice of weights
