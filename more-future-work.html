<h2>Future work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Comparison with tools in the randomForest package</li>
<li>make it work if categorical variables are includes in the inputs that aren&#39;t of interest</li>
<li>make it work for categorical variables as input of interest</li>
<li>unit testing</li>
<li>uncertainty 

<ul>
<li>it would be pretty easy to allow for multiple samples of parameters and plot uncertainties as in the paper</li>
<li>I&#39;m also interested in the uncertainty that arises from the density estimation as. I&#39;m not that excited about displaying one source of uncertainty without at least having a sense for the other.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>deal with potential column name conflicts in data frames (e.g. what if &ldquo;weight&rdquo; is already a column of X, but I try to use it&hellip;)</li>
<li>make it faster &ndash; with large N, we should make distance matrix (much faster than I am now) and only keep a smaller number of the closest points</li>
<li>better &amp; more automated choice of weights</li>
</ul>
