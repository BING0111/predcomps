<h2>Future work</h2>

<h3>Comparison with other approaches</h3>

<p>For example, I&#39;d like to compare with the tools (variable importance and partial plots) available in the <code>randomForest</code> package. I would guess that those tools are the most similar thing to this that&#39;s in common use.</p>

<p>Other notions of variable importance to compare with:</p>

<ul>
<li>the one in the <code>earth</code> package (implementing MARS)</li>
<li>I should look through <code>caret</code> to see what&#39;s available there</li>
</ul>

<h3>Categorical inputs</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not quite sure about the best way to sample from the distribution for an input of interest, conditional on the other inputs, when those other inputs include categorical variables.</p>

<p>Gelman &amp; Pardoe 2007 discuss what to do when the input of interest is an unordered categorical variable, but I&#39;m mainly interested in applying the statistic I&#39;m calling <a href="impact.html"><em>impact</em></a> to categorical variables, since <em>impact</em> is comparable across all types of inputs.</p>

<h3>Uncertainty</h3>

<p>As discussed in the paper, it is entirely natural to allow for multiple samples of parameters and plot these measures with their uncertainties as in the paper.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also interested in the uncertainty that arises from the density estimation. </p>

<h3>Weights</h3>

<p>More study is necessary to understand better what the weights should be, and make automated choices.</p>

<h3>Code robustness</h3>

<p>I should deal with potential column name conflicts in data frames (e.g. I use a &ldquo;Weight&rdquo; column, so I&#39;ll have problems if one of the inputs has that name).</p>
