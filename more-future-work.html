<h2>Future work</h2>

<h3>Categorical inputs</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not quite sure about the best way to sample from the distribution for an input of interest, conditional on the other inputs, when those other inputs include categorical variables.</p>

<p>Gelman &amp; Pardoe 2007 discuss what to do when the input of interest is an unordered categorical variable, but I&#39;m mainly interested in applying the statistic I&#39;m calling <a href="impact.html"><em>impact</em></a> to categorical variables, since <em>impact</em> is comparable across all types of inputs.</p>

<h3>Distribution of predictive comparisons</h3>

<p>Rigth now we&#39;re just providing point summaries. It&#39;d be nice to see the distribution. (This is different from accounting for model uncertainty.)</p>

<h3>Uncertainty</h3>

<p>As discussed in the paper, it is entirely natural to allow for multiple samples of parameters and plot these measures with their uncertainties as in the paper.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also interested in the uncertainty that arises from the density estimation. </p>

<h3>Weights</h3>

<p>More work is necessary to understand better what the weights should be / how to best represent the appropriate conditional distributions. Maybe in some cases we should even drop the distance-based approach and use something like BART?</p>

<h3>Code robustness</h3>

<p>I should deal with potential column name conflicts in data frames (e.g. I use a &ldquo;Weight&rdquo; column, so I&#39;ll have problems if one of the inputs has that name).</p>

<h3>Other tools/methods for understanding complicated models</h3>

<p>I&#39;d like to compile a list of other work in this direction, maybe comparing them with this (and perhaps giving examples that show why/when you&#39;d want to use this instead).</p>

<p>I should add a page discussing other methods people have used to get at somewhat the same idea.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>randomForest</code> package in R (partial plots, variable importance)</li>
<li><code>earth</code> package in R (variable importance)</li>
<li>I should look through <code>caret</code> to see what&#39;s available there</li>
</ul>
