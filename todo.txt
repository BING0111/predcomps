- make apc function take *either* a function to compute yHat, *or* a glm object
- demonstrate on simulated linear regression example
- demonstrate on simulated logistic regression example

## Some features a nice simulated example will illustrate:

Linear regression:

- difference between signed and absolute APC (one can be large while the other is 0, if effects can have opposite signs)
- given two inputs, each interacting with another (in the same way), the an input has larger APC if it's more likely to occur with values of the other that faciliate the interaction

Logistic regression



## Further away

- deal with potential column name conflicts in data frames (e.g. what if "weight" is already a column of X)
