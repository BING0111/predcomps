This README is mainly for people developing the project (which is just me, at the moment). Everything for users is at the [Project Page](http://www.davidchudzicki.com/predcomps/).

Lots of people are using complicated/non-parametric models for lots of things, but itâ€™s hard to understand what complicated models are telling you. This is general-purpose way to extract understanding from a very large class of complicated models.

## Todos

- Update language in descriptions of things. ("APC" is the general concept, with two variants: `PerUnitInput` and `Impact`.  

See the [future work](http://www.davidchudzicki.com/predcomps/more-future-work.html) section of the documentation.
