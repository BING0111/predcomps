This README is mainly for people developing the project (which is just me, at the moment). Everything for users is at the [Project Page](http://www.davidchudzicki.com/predcomps/).

Lots of people are using complicated/non-parametric models for lots of things, but itâ€™s hard to understand what complicated models are telling you. This is general-purpose way to extract understanding from a very large class of complicated models.

# Todo 

## Must be done before releasing to the world

Finishing pages:
- add example in quickstart section to index.
- finish simulated logistic regression example
- make make diamonds presentable
- another example, e.g. give me some credit (nice b/c it's logistic)
- document every function other people would use, with example
- Transition Plots -- maybe add another way to visualize the same effect, e.g. input vs. delta output? and/or improve the original one (opacity?)
	- something like this?: make 30 pairings for each of 100 original points. Draw lines instead of arrows. (include the original point for this! current pairs DF excludes original point.) maybe very thin lines with large and somewhat transparent points? for a sense of the density. 

## Todo later

See the [future work](http://www.davidchudzicki.com/predcomps/more-future-work.html) section of the documentation.
