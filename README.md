This README is mainly for people developing the project (which is just me, at the moment). Everything for users is at the [Project Page](http://www.davidchudzicki.com/predcomps/).

Lots of people are using complicated/non-parametric models for lots of things, but itâ€™s hard to understand what complicated models are telling you. This is general-purpose way to extract understanding from a very large class of complicated models.

## Todo later

See the [future work](http://www.davidchudzicki.com/predcomps/more-future-work.html) section of the documentation.

## Documentation

The [documentation](http://www.davidchudzicki.com/predcomps/) is hosted on Github pages using a theme by [orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist).

## Next steps for me:

- blog post for Kaggle blog
- presentation (for event hosted at Kaggle, or for another meetup)
- send some e-mails

### A page on alternatives

I should add a page discussing other methods people have used to get at somewhat the same idea.

- `randomForest` package in R (partial plots, variable importance)
- `earth` package in R (variable importance)
